This is a service publishing the spectra from the first Byurakan
spectral survey.

We got the data from Daniel, who in turn got it from the old Italian
web service.

The test data assumed can be obtained by

scp arvo-registry.sci.am:/var/gavo/inputs/dfbs_spec/data/fbs1163-DFBSJ01561\* data/

Questions to Areg:

* What to put in as creation date for the files?  [version indicator]
* What to use for bandpass id ("blue"? "visual"?)
* target class: anyone working on providing one?
* are stat and sys errors known?
* what other values are possible for spectrum class?
* What's spectrum length?  Pixels in files or pixels on plate?
* Red bord position?


Work out how to figure out:

* dateObs, timeExt, spec*
