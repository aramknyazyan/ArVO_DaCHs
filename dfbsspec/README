This is a service publishing the spectra from the first Byurakan
spectral survey.

The input data is a dump of the mysql database behind the Italian
spectra server.

The test data I made with

zcat byurakan-spettri.sql.gz | head -490 | tail -60 | gzip > sample.sql.gz

TODO

* Can we add error estimates (Areg's ideas: use background level,
  perhaps measured by limiting magnitude)
* Do we want x, y, and angle in the database table?  If so, what about
  units, orientation, etc?



The duplicated plateid problem
------------------------------

The plate ids for FBS 0966, 0326, and 0449 are given twice in WFPDB.
Here's the relevant fields:

    wfpdbid    | raj2000 | dej2000 |  object  |      epoch       | emulsion
---------------+---------+---------+----------+------------------+----------
 BYU102A002880 | 179.871 | 54.8386 | FBS 0326 | 1971.00479123888 | IIAF
 BYU102A002881 | 135.442 | 30.8853 | FBS 0326 | 1971.05681040383 | IIAF

    wfpdbid    | raj2000 | dej2000 |  object  |      epoch       | emulsion
---------------+---------+---------+----------+------------------+----------
 BYU102A003061 | 236.954 | 50.9117 | FBS 0449 | 1971.37987679671 | Zu-2
 BYU102A003062 | 187.858 |   29.84 | FBS 0449 | 1971.38809034908 | IIAF

    wfpdbid    | raj2000 | dej2000 |  object  |      epoch       | emulsion
---------------+---------+---------+----------+------------------+----------
 BYU102A005151 | 145.179 | 48.8817 | FBS 0966 | 1974.35865845311 | IIaF
 BYU102A004949 | 106.196 | 34.9586 | FBS 0966 | 1973.83846680356 | IIaF

Resolution:

We rename the later plates to NNNNa in both the plate and the spectrum
grammar; in the plate grammar, the distinction is based on the epoch.
When reading from the spectra, we distinguish by declination range
(see DECRANGES_FOR_PLATEID_DEDUP).
