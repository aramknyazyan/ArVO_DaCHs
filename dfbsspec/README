This is a service publishing the spectra from the first Byurakan
spectral survey.

We got the data from Daniel, who in turn got it from the old Italian
web service.

The test data assumed by the tests is in the folder test-data.  Copy it
into data/ to build a test service; do *not* copy it into data/ of the
live site, as the spectra are already in the full data set, and you'd
cause a primary key error.

TODO

* Can we add error estimates (Areg's ideas: use background level,
  perhaps measured by limiting magnitude)
* Figure out what "spectrum class" means
* What's with FBS 0966: There are two of them in WFPDB.  Same for 326
  and 449.
