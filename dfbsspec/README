This is a service publishing the spectra from the first Byurakan
spectral survey.

We got the data from Daniel, who in turn got it from the old Italian
web service.

The test data assumed can be obtained by

scp arvo-registry.sci.am:/var/gavo/inputs/dfbs_spec/data/fbs1163-DFBSJ01561\* data/

TODO

* Can we add error estimates (Areg's ideas: use background level,
  perhaps measured by limiting magnitude)
* Figure out what "spectrum class" means
* What's with FBS 0966: There are two of them in WFPDB.  Same for 326
  and 449.
