This is a service publishing the spectra from the first Byurakan
spectral survey.

We got the data from Daniel, who in turn got it from the old Italian
web service.

The test data assumed can be obtained by

scp arvo-registry.sci.am:/var/gavo/inputs/dfbs_spec/data/DFBS_ALL_10/fbs1163-DFBSJ01561\* data/
