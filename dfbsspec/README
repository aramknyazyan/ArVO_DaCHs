This is a service publishing the spectra from the first Byurakan
spectral survey.

We got the data from Daniel, who in turn got it from the old Italian
web service.

The test data assumed can be obtained by

scp arvo-registry.sci.am:/var/gavo/inputs/dfbs_spec/data/fbs1163-DFBSJ01561\* data/

Questions to Areg:

* What to put in as creation date for the files?  [version indicator; 
  can we reconstruct extraction time]
* What to use for bandpass id -- use emulsion name from plate
* are stat and sys errors known? -- use background level of plate?  or
  from limiting magnitude?  TODO at workshop
* what other values are possible for spectrum class -- look at web page
* What's spectrum length?  Pixels in files or pixels on plate?
* Red bord position -- distance from extraction start to cutout edge
  (anything greatly different from 16 is a sign of trouble)


Work out how to figure out:

* dateObs, timeExt
