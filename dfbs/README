IMPORTANT: q.rd, README, and bin/ are currently *both* in the GAVO SVN and at
https://github.com/aramknyazyan/ArVO_DaCHs.git It is currently being
synchronised between the two (if at all) by hand.

These are the full plate scans of the DFBS.  They were scraped off a
machine in Trieste that, in turn, was a clone of the machine on which
DFBS serialisation was done.

The original files had various problems; in particular the astrometric
calibration still DSS-style, and many headers had non-ASCII in them.
The local bin/addstandardheaders.py fixes that as far as possible, also
adding metadata from WFPDB.

Quite a few FITSes are still broken:

* fbs0584, fbs0587, fbs1165, fbs1187, fbs1824M didn't receive a 
	header, it seems.  Recovering them might be possible if it were 
	found worthwhile.
* fbs0324, fbs1825M, fbs1828M, fbs1830M, fbs1831M, fbs1832M, fbs1834M,
  fbs1834_, fbs1835M, fbs1836M, fbs1837M, fbs1838M, fbs1839M, fbs1840M,
  fbs1841M, fbs1842M, fbs1875, fbs1882, fbs1883, fbs2064, fbs2231, fbs2234,
  fbs2235, fbs2237, fbs2242, fbs2243, fbs2244, fbs2247 are not in WFPDB.
  If they were entered there, they'd probably just work.
* fbsanon+38_cor -- who knows?

Anyway, a trigger in the q.rd only accepts plates with updated headers.
It'll know them by the presence of the WFPDB-ID header.


The test set is fbs2008_cor.fits; to allow space-saving cutouts, tests
should only look at the central 0.1 degrees.
