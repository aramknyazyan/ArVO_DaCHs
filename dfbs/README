These are the original full plate scans of the DFBS.  Aram got them in
2018 from disks stored at the Byurakan archive.

Temporary status: There's too many problems with bad header cards and
the ancient WCS.  Research ways to fix both issues.


Open questions:

(1) The header for FBS1325_COR.FITS contains ac02 in the header (at
offsets ~000004a0 and ~000004f0).  That makes them invalid -- where
do they come from?

(2) How do we get basic metadata on these (observation date, exposure
time, emulsion used, ...)?

(3) How do we find out what field was observed on a given plate (ideally
without going through the astrometrical reduction).

(4) It would be really great if new-style WCS headers could be attached
to the scans (research standard tools to turn DSS-style WCS into
standard FITS-WCS.
